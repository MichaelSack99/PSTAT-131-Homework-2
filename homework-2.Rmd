## Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("tidymodels")
#install.packages('yardstick')
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(yardstick)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
abalone <- read_csv("/Users/michellesack/Desktop/UCSB/Senior yr/Spring/PSTAT 131/homework-2/data/abalone.csv")
abalone %>% 
  head()
```

### Question 1


Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.


```{r}
abalone <- abalone %>% 
  mutate(age = rings + 1.5) %>% 
  select(-rings)
```
  
Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```{r}
hist(abalone$age)
```

As you can see from the histogram above, the distribution of the age of the abalones closely resembles that of the normal distribution. Most abalones are between 8-14 years old. There are very few abalone younger that 5 years old or older that 20 years old.

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r}
set.seed(1592)

abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = age)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

```{r}
abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~ ., data = abalone_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_center(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_scale(all_numeric_predictors())
abalone_recipe
```
```{r}
interaction_1 <- step_interact(abalone_recipe, terms = ~ type:shucked_weight)
interaction_1 <- prep(interaction_1, training = abalone_train)
interaction_2 <- step_interact(abalone_recipe, terms = ~ longest_shell:diameter)
interaction_2 <- prep(interaction_2, training = abalone_train)
interaction_3 <- step_interact(abalone_recipe, terms = ~ shucked_weight:shell_weight)
interaction_3 <- prep(interaction_3, training = abalone_train)
```
### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

```{r}
lm_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")
```

### Question 5

Now:

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

```{r}
lm_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe)
```


### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.

```{r}
lm_fit <- fit(lm_wflow, abalone_train)
abalone_prediction <- data.frame(type = 'F', longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1)
print(predict(lm_fit,abalone_prediction))
```

We can view the model results:

```{r}
lm_fit %>% 
  # This returns the parsnip object:
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>% 
  # Now tidy the linear model object:
  tidy()
```

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).

2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).

3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.

```{r}
abalone_metrics <- metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae)
abalone_metrics
```

```{r}
abalone_train_res <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = abalone_train %>% select(-age))
abalone_train_res <- bind_cols(abalone_train_res, abalone_train %>% select(age))
abalone_train_res %>% 
  head()
```
```{r}
abalone_metrics(abalone_train_res, truth = age, 
                estimate = .pred)
```

Our *R^2^* value came out to about 0.53. This tells us that our prediction is not that accurate, and that we should likely conduct more tests!

We can construct a plot of predicted values vs. actual values to help visualize the accuracy of our predictions:

```{r}
abalone_train_res %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .pred, y = age)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) + 
  theme_bw() +
  coord_obs_pred()
```
